Based on Statcast expected metrics, BABIP luck, and contact quality analysis.

TWEET 1 (HOOK):
The market is overvaluing these hitters heading into 2026.

Our model flagged 8 hitters whose 2025 numbers were built on BABIP luck, unsustainable HR/FB rates, and xwOBA gaps that SCREAM regression.

Names you won't want to hear. Data you can't ignore.

TWEET 2 - Harrison Bader (SF Giants, age 32)
Regression Risk: 89/100

SURFACE: .346 wOBA in 2025 looked like a career year. 501 PA, finally healthy.
REALITY: His xwOBA was .297 -- a +49 POINT gap. That's the 2nd-largest gap in MLB.

2023 -> 2024 -> 2025:
- Barrel%: 5.3 -> 6.4 -> 10.2 (career high, but...)
- BABIP: .261 -> .276 -> .359 (career avg ~.275)
- K%: 17.2 -> 21.7 -> 27.1 (trending the WRONG way)

His BABIP was 84 points above career average. That's not a new skill -- that's luck.
The barrels improved but the strikeout rate spiked to 27.1%. Hard to sustain both.

VERDICT: Expect .280-.295 wOBA range. The .346 was a mirage.

TWEET 3 - Nick Kurtz (Athletics, age 23)
Regression Risk: 97/100

SURFACE: Explosive debut -- .419 wOBA, 92.7 EV, 18.4% barrel rate. Electric.
REALITY: xwOBA was .372. Still good! But the gap matters.

2025 (debut):
- HR/FB: 37.9% (league avg ~12%)
- K%: 30.9% (elite power, but how many of those fly balls keep leaving?)
- BABIP: .364 (rookie-year inflation)
- Chase%: 22.2% (genuinely elite plate discipline)
- Whiff%: 35.5% (high -- pitchers will exploit this)

The 37.9% HR/FB rate is the red flag. Even the best power hitters (Judge, Stanton)
sit around 25-30%. Regression to ~22-25% HR/FB alone drops his SLG by 60+ points.

The talent is REAL -- 92.7 EV and 51.1% hard hit are legitimate. But 2026 projections
should be closer to .350-.370 wOBA, not .419. Still a good hitter, just not a monster.

VERDICT: Star talent, but the debut was inflated by an absurd HR/FB rate. Expect a
"sophomore slump" that's really just normalization.

TWEET 4 - Trea Turner (Phillies, age 33)
Regression Risk: 76/100

SURFACE: .352 wOBA over 639 PA. Looked like vintage Trea.
REALITY: xwOBA was .321 -- a +31 point gap. And the contact quality is fading.

2023 -> 2024 -> 2025:
- Barrel%: 8.4 -> 6.9 -> 5.8 (declining every year)
- BABIP: .310 -> .331 -> .350 (rising -- propping up results)
- EV: 89.9 -> 89.1 -> 89.3 (stable, but barrels are disappearing)
- HR/FB: trending down from 19% to 14%

At 33, his speed is declining and his barrel rate has dropped 31% in two years.
The .350 BABIP is doing all the heavy lifting. Career BABIP is .315.

The plate discipline actually improved (K% down to 16.7%, chase down to 31%),
but when your barrels are drying up, contact quality matters more than contact rate.

VERDICT: .310-.325 wOBA is more realistic. The elite speed that fueled his BABIP
is fading, and the power tool is nearly gone.

TWEET 5 - Jose Altuve (Astros, age 36)
Regression Risk: 76/100

SURFACE: .331 wOBA with 654 PA. Iron man season. Still productive.
REALITY: xwOBA was .300 -- the underlying numbers are deteriorating.

2023 -> 2024 -> 2025:
- EV: 86.0 -> 86.5 -> 85.1 (losing exit velocity at 36)
- Barrel%: 8.3 -> 6.5 -> 6.2 (power fading)
- Chase%: 32.1 -> 37.3 -> 38.9 (discipline eroding)
- BABIP: .348 -> .337 -> .283 (already starting to correct)

The good news: his BABIP actually came DOWN in 2025, meaning his .331 wOBA was
achieved despite less luck. But the chase rate climbing to 38.9% is concerning.

At 36, the bat speed is declining (EV down 1.4 mph from 2023), he's chasing more,
and barreling less. This is the classic aging profile.

VERDICT: Still a productive hitter due to elite hand-eye, but the floor is dropping.
Expect .300-.310 wOBA. The .330+ days are numbered.

TWEET 6 - Hunter Goodman (Rockies, age 27)
Regression Risk: 77/100

SURFACE: .359 wOBA with 12.8% barrel rate and 90.8 EV. Breakout in Colorado.
REALITY: xwOBA was .324. Playing in Coors inflates EVERYTHING.

2023 -> 2024 -> 2025:
- wOBA: .266 -> .274 -> .359 (suspicious jump)
- xwOBA: .267 -> .283 -> .324 (real improvement is ~40pts, not ~95pts)
- K%: 31.2 -> 28.6 -> 26.3 (improving!)
- BABIP: .277 -> .199 -> .331 (from unlucky to lucky)
- HR/FB: 12.5% -> 31.4% -> 27.9% (Coors-inflated)

The real improvement is legitimate -- xwOBA went from .283 to .324, K% dropped,
and he's pulling the ball more (pull air rate jumped to 48.7%).

But the gap between .324 xwOBA and .359 wOBA is Coors Field doing its thing.
His road splits will tell the real story.

VERDICT: True talent is ~.320-.330 wOBA. The raw power is real but Coors
inflates it by ~30-35 points. Still useful, but not a .359 hitter.

TWEET 7 - Sal Frelick (Brewers, age 26) & Shea Langeliers (Athletics, age 28)

FRELICK (risk: 80):
- 2025: .332 wOBA, but only 3.1% barrel rate and 85.5 EV
- xwOBA: .299 -- a +33 point gap
- His game is BABIP-dependent (contact + speed), but .317 is already above average
- Only 27.4% hard hit rate. When the BABIP normalizes, there's no power to fall back on.
- VERDICT: .295-.305 wOBA. Contact-first profile with a low ceiling.

LANGELIERS (risk: 74):
- 2025: .364 wOBA, which was a MASSIVE jump from .290/.315 in 2023-24
- K% dropped from 29.2% to 19.7% (suspicious -- that's an 10-point drop in one year)
- HR/FB: 27.9% (career avg ~24%)
- BABIP: .290 (actually reasonable for once)
- xwOBA: .328 vs .364 wOBA (+36 point gap)
- VERDICT: The K% drop is real and sustainable if the approach held. But .340+ wOBA
  requires the HR/FB rate to stay elevated. Expect .320-.335 wOBA -- still good, just
  not .364.

TWEET 8 - The Counter-Argument:

Why the market might disagree:
- Bader: New ballpark in SF, better coaching staff
- Kurtz: Genuinely elite raw power could sustain higher HR/FB than average
- Turner: Elite bat-to-ball skills age well
- Altuve: Inner-circle talent, has beaten age curves before
- Goodman: Coors or not, 90.8 EV is legit
- Langeliers: If the K% drop is real (approach change), the rest follows

Fair points. But expected metrics don't care about narratives.
The data says these numbers will come back to earth.

TWEET 9 - Summary Table:

Player          | 2025 wOBA | xwOBA | Gap   | Proj 2026
Bader           | .346      | .297  | +49   | .280-.295
Kurtz           | .419      | .372  | +47   | .350-.370
Turner          | .352      | .321  | +31   | .310-.325
Altuve          | .331      | .300  | +31   | .300-.310
Goodman         | .359      | .324  | +35   | .320-.330
Frelick         | .332      | .299  | +33   | .295-.305
Langeliers      | .364      | .328  | +36   | .320-.335

Average xwOBA gap: +37 points. That's not skill. That's luck.

TWEET 10:

The market prices in the box score. We price in the underlying data.

Every single one of these hitters outperformed their expected metrics in 2025.
History says that gap closes. Every. Single. Time.

Fade accordingly.

METHODOLOGY NOTE:
- All data from Baseball Savant (Statcast) and our Marcel-weighted projection system
- Regression risk scores from our proprietary model (0-100 scale)
- xwOBA gap = actual wOBA minus expected wOBA (positive = overperformance)
- BABIP comparison uses 3-year career average as baseline
- Projections factor in age curves, park effects, and contact quality trends
