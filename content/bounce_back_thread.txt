BOUNCE-BACK THREAD - 2026 MLB Season
=======================================
"These Hitters Are Being Slept On Heading Into 2026"
Based on Statcast expected metrics, BABIP bad luck, and contact quality analysis.

Thread below

TWEET 1 (HOOK):
The surface numbers lied about these hitters in 2025.

Our model flagged 8 hitters whose UNDERLYING contact quality was significantly
better than their results showed. BABIP bad luck, sequencing, and variance
crushed their stat lines.

Expected metrics paint a VERY different picture.

TWEET 2 - Salvador Perez (Royals, age 36)
Bounce-Back Score: 100/100

SURFACE: .311 wOBA in 641 PA. Down year for Salvy. Aging catcher, right?
REALITY: His xwOBA was .357 -- a -46 POINT gap. He was the UNLUCKIEST hitter in MLB.

2023 -> 2024 -> 2025:
- Barrel%: 8.8 -> 12.2 -> 14.8 (career high! Getting BETTER)
- Hard Hit%: 44.0 -> 44.8 -> 46.7 (career high!)
- xwOBA: .326 -> .361 -> .357 (elite contact quality two years running)
- BABIP: .294 -> .302 -> .251 (FORTY-SEVEN points below career average)

His BABIP cratered to .251 despite hitting the ball harder than ever. That's pure
bad luck -- balls finding gloves instead of gaps.

The barrel rate IMPROVED for the third straight year. The hard hit rate is at a
career high. At 36, most catchers are declining -- Salvy is somehow getting better
at making hard contact.

Chase rate dropped from 47% to 42.4%, whiff rate from 30.2% to 26.9%. Even the
discipline is trending the right direction.

VERDICT: Expect .340-.355 wOBA. The power is REAL and the BABIP will normalize.
This is a buy-low screaming at you.

TWEET 3 - Oneil Cruz (Pirates, age 28)
Bounce-Back Score: 99/100

SURFACE: .295 wOBA in 544 PA. Disappointing follow-up to his 2024 breakout.
REALITY: xwOBA was .324 -- and his raw tools are ABSURD.

2024 -> 2025:
- EV: 95.5 -> 95.8 (top 1% in MLB. Only Judge and Stanton are in this tier)
- Barrel%: 15.7 -> 17.9 (INCREASED)
- Hard Hit%: 54.9 -> 56.6 (INCREASED)
- BABIP: .347 -> .262 (EIGHTY-FIVE points below his 2024)
- K%: 30.2 -> 32.0 (still too high, but...)
- BB%: 8.5 -> 11.8 (improved significantly!)
- Chase%: 31.7 -> 28.1 (BETTER discipline)

Everything under the hood got BETTER. His exit velocity is 95.8 mph -- that's
historically elite. His barrel rate jumped to 17.9%. His walk rate improved by
3.3 percentage points. His chase rate dropped.

The ONLY thing that went wrong was a .262 BABIP. With his speed and hard contact,
that should be .310-320. That's a 50-60 point correction waiting to happen.

VERDICT: .340-.360 wOBA with 35+ HR upside. The tools are generational.
His .295 wOBA was one of the most misleading stat lines in 2025.

TWEET 4 - Juan Soto (Mets, age 28)
Bounce-Back Score: 98/100

SURFACE: .390 wOBA in 715 PA. Most players would KILL for this line.
REALITY: His xwOBA was .429. He LEFT production on the table.

2023 -> 2024 -> 2025:
- Barrel%: 13.0 -> 19.7 -> 18.1 (elite tier)
- xwOBA: .407 -> .463 -> .429 (consistently top-5 in MLB)
- BABIP: .296 -> .298 -> .270 (28 points below career norm)
- Chase%: 16.6 -> 18.3 -> 15.9 (MLB's BEST chase rate)
- BB%: 18.6 -> 18.1 -> 17.8 (most disciplined hitter in baseball)

Yes, .390 wOBA is amazing. But Soto's TRUE talent level is .420-.430.
The gap between .390 and .429 xwOBA is about 15-20 points of wRC+.

His chase rate of 15.9% is the BEST in MLB. His barrel rate is 18.1%.
His walk rate is 17.8%. This is a generational plate appearance.

The "down year" was caused by a .270 BABIP -- 28 points below his career average.
When that normalizes, he's back to being the best hitter in baseball.

VERDICT: .415-.430 wOBA. First year in the Mets lineup, expect the crown back.
The $765M man is worth every penny.

TWEET 5 - Seiya Suzuki (Cubs, age 32)
Bounce-Back Score: 96/100

SURFACE: .343 wOBA over 651 PA. Solid but unspectacular.
REALITY: xwOBA was .352, but the real story is the BABIP.

2023 -> 2024 -> 2025:
- BABIP: .341 -> .370 -> .282 (career average is .356 -- he was 74 POINTS below)
- Barrel%: 10.5 -> 11.5 -> 16.6 (CAREER HIGH by a wide margin)
- Pull Air%: 37.0 -> 32.6 -> 41.9 (pulling the ball in the air more = HR intent)
- K%: 22.3 -> 27.4 -> 25.2 (improved from '24)
- Chase%: 19.8 -> 20.7 -> 20.5 (consistently elite)

Suzuki had a 16.6% barrel rate in 2025 -- that's top-20 in MLB. He pulled the ball
in the air at 41.9%, the highest rate of his career. He's clearly selling out for power.

And it WORKED in terms of contact quality. But his BABIP crashed to .282, wiping out
all the improvement. Career BABIP is .356 -- a 74-point gap.

The approach shift is real and sustainable. The BABIP won't stay at .282.

VERDICT: .360-.375 wOBA. The power breakout is real. When luck normalizes,
Suzuki could post a career year at 32.

TWEET 6 - Adley Rutschman (Orioles, age 28)
Bounce-Back Score: 93/100

SURFACE: .298 wOBA in just 365 PA. Injuries limited him. Concerning.
REALITY: xwOBA was .325 -- and the underlying profile screams elite.

2023 -> 2024 -> 2025:
- xwOBA: .374 -> .320 -> .325 (bouncing back from 2024 dip)
- BABIP: .303 -> .272 -> .240 (TWO straight years of BABIP hell)
- K%: 14.7 -> 16.1 -> 15.6 (elite contact ability)
- BB%: 13.4 -> 9.1 -> 11.0 (walk rate recovering)
- Chase%: 23.4 -> 28.9 -> 21.7 (chase rate PLUMMETED -- best of career)
- Whiff%: 17.1 -> 14.5 (career low!)
- Barrel%: 7.5 -> 6.1 -> 7.5 (back to 2023 level)

Rutschman's .240 BABIP is absurd for a hitter with his contact profile.
His whiff rate dropped to 14.5% (career low), his chase rate dropped to 21.7%
(career low), and his K% stayed at an elite 15.6%.

He's making the BEST contact of his career by process metrics, and getting the
WORST results. That's the definition of bad luck.

With health, his true talent is .340-.360 wOBA. Even the conservative projection
at .332 xwOBA-adjusted is far above his .298 result.

VERDICT: .340-.360 wOBA with full health. The process has never been better.
Buy the dip on the best young catcher in baseball.

TWEET 7 - Corey Seager (Rangers, age 32) & Luis Robert Jr. (Mets, age 29)

SEAGER (bb: 90):
- 2025: .365 wOBA looks solid, but xwOBA was .400 -- he left 35 points on the table
- EV: 92.9 (elite), Barrel%: 15.3% (elite), Hard Hit%: 53.6% (elite)
- BABIP: .299 (career avg ~.320)
- BB% jumped from 9.9% to 13.0% -- became MORE patient
- Chase% dropped to 23.0% (career best)
- Every single process metric improved or held. Results didn't follow.
- VERDICT: .385-.400 wOBA. Seager's elite contact quality demands a correction.

ROBERT JR. (bb: 88):
- 2025: .289 wOBA in 431 PA. Another "lost" season.
- xwOBA: .321 -- a -32 point gap
- K% dropped from 33.2% to 26.0% (massive 7-point improvement!)
- BB% up from 6.6% to 9.3%
- Chase% down from 35.9% to 32.5%
- BABIP: .274 (should be ~.310 with his speed)
- Barrel%: 10.2%, EV: 89.4 -- the power tools are still there
- VERDICT: .320-.340 wOBA if healthy. The discipline transformation is the story.
  If the K% improvement sticks, he's a completely different hitter.

TWEET 8 - Nolan Jones (Guardians, age 28)
Bounce-Back Score: 90/100

SURFACE: .270 wOBA in 403 PA. Looked like 2023 was a fluke.
REALITY: The tools suggest otherwise.

2023 -> 2024 -> 2025:
- EV: 90.1 -> 88.2 -> 90.8 (bounced back to 2023 level)
- Barrel%: 15.7 -> 5.9 -> 8.5 (recovering from 2024 crater)
- Hard Hit%: 41.3 -> 44.4 -> 46.7 (career high!)
- xwOBA: .362 -> .291 -> .301 (trending back up)
- BABIP: .401 -> .333 -> .292 (now BELOW average)
- K%: 29.7 -> 30.6 -> 28.0 (slight improvement)

His 2023 (.395 wOBA) was inflated by a .401 BABIP. His 2025 (.270 wOBA) was
deflated by a .292 BABIP. The truth is somewhere in the middle.

The exit velocity rebounded to 90.8, hard hit% is at a career high, and the
barrel rate is recovering from its 2024 collapse. His xwOBA of .301 suggests
true talent around .310-.320 wOBA.

VERDICT: .310-.325 wOBA. Not the 2023 star, not the 2025 bust.
A solid 2-3 WAR player when the luck normalizes.

TWEET 9 - The Counter-Argument:

Why the market is pricing these guys lower:
- Perez: He's 36. Catchers age fast.
- Cruz: 32% K rate is still a real problem
- Soto: .390 is already elite -- hard to improve
- Suzuki: K% still elevated at 25%
- Rutschman: Health is the real question
- Seager: Age 32, declining speed
- Robert: Can't stay on the field
- Jones: Still strikes out too much

Valid concerns. But expected metrics account for strikeouts and contact quality.
The BABIP gap is the part the market gets wrong.

*Suzuki's gap is small in xwOBA but his BABIP was 74pts below career avg

Average xwOBA gap: -31 points of suppressed production.

These hitters were punished by bad luck, not bad skill.
The data says buy. The market says sell.

We're buying.

METHODOLOGY NOTE:
- All data from Baseball Savant (Statcast) and our Marcel-weighted projection system
- Bounce-back scores from our proprietary model (0-100 scale)
- xwOBA gap = actual wOBA minus expected wOBA (negative = underperformance)
- BABIP comparison uses 3-year career average as baseline
- Projections factor in age curves, park effects, and contact quality trends
- "Career avg BABIP" = Marcel-weighted 3-year average (5/4/3 weighting)
